KCNW,3/19/2025,The hold short line for 17R at taxiway G (In between the duals of 17L and 17R) is not marked by a red runway sign!  The hold short line is faded and it is easy to miss. -Shady

KJAN,10/07/24,"Start cart available at Atlantic Aviation, must call and precoordinate, they get it from the ANG at the airport. -BAM-B"
KSWF,10/15/24,"Attempted XC here but was thwarted by weather, but here is my planning experience.  Atlantic aviation has contract fuel. They could acquire a start cart in a pinch, but didnt have one readily available. The air guard side has fuel and start cart, and was happy to give me a PPR (email 105.AW.OSS.AMOPS.Org@us.af.mil) to park there(on the marine ramp). They have a swing shift, so can work evening/weekend hours. They said they could get me to the gate, or maybe even to the civilian side for a rental car pick up. -Radio"
KHOU,11/13/24,"WHITE LISTED AIRPORT. Wilson Air Center does not have contract gas. Thye were called and Ms. Lystasia confirmed they do not have contract fuel, but they will give a discount to military and government planes. Possible mislabel on Foreflight."
KHRL,11/25/2024,Start cart is extremely weak and took 4 attempts to get the right engine started. Each attempt it took almost at 30 seconds to reach 12%. We asked the ground crew to increase the pressure before we were able to get a good start on the 4th attempt. -Conky
KNQA,5/11/2025,Landed on 5/9/25. Working air start cart -IKE
KDAB,5/11/2025,Landed on 4/23/25. Working air start cart. -IKE
KPBI,6/15/2025,The coupler of the American Airlines air start cart does not fit the T38.  The coupler of the air start cart of UPS does fit the T38.  Contact Big Sky Aviation for coordination.  -Shady
KGRK,6/30/2025,"Air start cart available through base ops (army side).  Airfield is not very busy during the day and very accommodating.  Air start cart makes a sounds like it's winding down after light off, but both engines started normally.  Limited water and food options (vending machine only).  Army side requires a PPR and a 10 minute out call via Pilot Dispatch radio (125.05).  You have to pay the fuel truck operator directly.  They support a lot of AF T-38s.  AF T-38s have a pouch on the fuel door where the fuel trucker is used to stowing the card and receipt in.  Since we done have that same stowage area, I had the fueler stow the card and receipt in the fuel precheck compartment and then I picked it up during the preflight.  Alternatively you could wait there until the fuel trucker finishes and have him/her hand it directly to you.  It can be a very quick turn and an easy place to conduct practice approaches.  -Shady"
