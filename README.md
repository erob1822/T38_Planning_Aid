# T38PlanAid_EvansVersion
Parallel version of the T38 planaid with specific changes made to increase efficency/modularity. Goal is to create a working script, but not to replace the main version, more to find edits to suggest.

To create an exportable .exe, just run "build_exe.py" and you should come out with a folder containing both the .exe and the .xlsx it needs to run. Just zip and send.
